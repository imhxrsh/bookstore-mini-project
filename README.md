# Bookstore Mini-Project

Welcome to the Bookstore Mini-Project, a simple application written in PHP, HTML, and CSS that allows users to browse and purchase books online.

# Setup
 To set up the Bookstore Mini-Project, you will need to have the following dependencies installed on your system:
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- A web server (such as Apache or Nginx)
- A MySQL database server

Setup database:
1. Make a database named `bookstore_db`.
2. Import the `bookstore_db.sql` file into the database.
3. Use the `config.php` file to configure the database connection. (Only if you know what you are doing !)
4. Use the admin username and password to login to the admin panel. (Default username: `admin@gmail.com` and password: `admin`)
5. Add books to the database using the admin panel.


Once you have these dependencies installed, you can clone the repository to your local machine and start the web server to access the website.

# Usage
To access the bookstore, simply visit the URL of the web server in your web browser. From there, you can browse through the available books and add buy them.
